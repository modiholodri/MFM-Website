        </h2>
        <p class="lead text-center">Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply
          with the following criteria.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>1. Free Redistribution</h3>
        <p>
          The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software
          distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other
          fee for such sale.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Source Code</h3>
        <p>
          The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form
          of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source
          code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge. The
          source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated
          source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Derived Works</h3>
        <p>
          The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the
          license of the original software.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code</h3>
        <p>
          The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution
          of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must
          explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works
          to carry a different name or version number from the original software.
        </p>
        <h3>5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</h3>
        <p>
          The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</h3>
        <p>
          The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may
          not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Distribution of License</h3>
        <p>
          The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution
          of an additional license by those parties.
        </p>
        <h3>8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</h3>
        <p>
          The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If
          the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license,
          all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction
          with the original software distribution.
        </p>
        <h3>9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software</h3>
        <p>
          The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example,
          the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.
        </p>
        <h3>10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral</h3>
        <p>
          No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
